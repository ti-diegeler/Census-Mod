This is a private modding project for the Unity-reliant game [Cities: Skylines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/). It is intended to display proprietary demography data of CitizenUnits as a part of its internal UI. 

It was developed using the [MS Visual Studo 2022 IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/) and included several dependencies from the Colossal Framework. An initial setup guide is given via [this link].(https://skylines.paradoxwikis.com/Advanced_Mod_Setup]
